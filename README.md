# Etherscan API Integration Project

This project integrates with the [Etherscan API](https://etherscan.io/apis) to retrieve Ethereum blockchain data and processes it using Kafka and Flink. The application also interacts with PostgreSQL for storing analyzed data, enabling further analytics and real-time insights.

## Features

- Fetches Ethereum blockchain transactions using Etherscan API.
- Processes transaction data via Apache Kafka.
- Includes Docker support for simplified setup.

## Project Structure

- **bin/**: Contains scripts for running or managing the application.
- **config/**: Configuration files (e.g., Kafka, database connections).
- **controller/**: Handles request processing and business logic.
- **routes/**: API endpoints for application interaction.
- **services/**: Backend logic for Kafka, database, or other integrations.
- **app.js**: Entry point for the Node.js application.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services (Kafka, Zookeeper, PostgreSQL) needed for the application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- Etherscan API Key

## Setup
